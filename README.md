# Data_Analytics

## Exercise 1
In exercise 1, I've performed basic statistical analysis to analyse the traffic in Bengaluru. The dataset used was downloaded from Kaggle and can be found in the repo as 'Banglore_traffic_Dataset.csv'

##Exercise 2
In Exercise 2, I've done Central Limit theorem sampling method and random sampling on the Iris dataset. Then, I have developed a new sampling method for the same dataset, where a random number from the min possible and max possible sepal length is generated, then if the sepal length exists in the dataset that row is added to the sample else the row with the closest value to it is added. The sampled dataset can be downloaded from the repo as 'sampled_iris_data.csv'.

##Exercise 3
In Exercise 3, I've performed T-test, Z test and Anova on the iris dataset and also represented the correlation between sepal length and petal length
